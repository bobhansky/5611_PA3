### control the simulation:
   arrow keys: move the root of the skeleton,
   c: switch the arm being controlled.

## â€¢ List of the tools/library you used && All code for your project with a clear indication of what code you wrote
     Vec2.pde is provided by Dr Stephen J Guy.

     
     All other files are written by me.


## Brief write-up explaining difficulties you encountered
   Implementing two arms shareing one segment is a work requires patience and careness: 
   conflict when updating two arms trying to reach the same endpoint may happen, so I only decide
   to allow user to control one arm. 

   For a resonable simulation (or looks resonable), I need to tune the angle limits carefully.
